      <p>Hello my name is Colin Richards. I was born and raised in Ogden Utah, I lived there until I was 19. I then spent
        a couple years in Everett Washington and now I am in Salt Lake City and I have been here for the past 5 years.</p>

      <p>I am really enjoying this coding bootcamp and I am so grateful for this experience. I am loving this new skill that
        I am developing and I can't wait to begin on some of my own projects.</p>
