             <p2>I am interested in several different things. I like to play basketball, workout, and do pretty much anything outdoors. I like to shop for and collect shoes. I am also building up a motorcycle right now, it is a 1979 cb750 that hopefull one day will run. I am very excited for this bootcamp, I have already learned so much. This assignment was a lot of fun but also very challenging. This has been a very rewarding process and I look forward to the rest of the bootcamp.</p2>

<!--There are a few things that I am missing for this assignment. My navigation bar is a little off.
I need to have the solid green background behind my name, I also need to line up the buttons better
on the bar. I think I need to play around with the margins and padding some more.. On the portfolio 
page, I need to center all of the images and lay the image boxes with text across them.-->
